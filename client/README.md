# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


My website is called Clueless, and uses Vite with JSX. I may have to add whoever is grading this to the MongoDB collaborator list, so if thats the case just message me on Slack, and I will add you. If for some reason the project doesn't run on your local machine please message and I will be happy to assist you. I worked very hard to create this website, and I need an 85% to pass the bootcamp. Please don't hesitate to reach out if theres any improvements I can make to ensure I reach this grade. Thank you so much for your teaching and assistance throughout the past months, Brandon Famiano.
